"""
Daily Instagram story copy.

Stories were shipping the same two hardcoded lines every day
("REAL COFFEE. ZERO CHICORY." / "Reply and tell me how you take your coffee")
because:

  - story generation is an extended-content LLM task
  - evergreen fallback never emitted a stories key
  - post_story treated missing story_1 as a brand slogan

This module resolves a headline + reply line from today's approved copy
(or a day-rotated label-safe bank) so the jar can change AND the words can.
