followers. No jar, no logo, no brand mention beyond the posting account.

VALUE-UNLOCK MODE (today's highest-priority mechanic):
This reel gives away a REAL free resource. Build the whole reel around teasing
it, then make commenting the keyword the way to receive it.
- Keyword to comment: {lm['keyword']}
- What the reel promises: {lm['promise']}
- Do NOT reveal the full resource in the reel — the value is unlocked by commenting.
- CTA must be: "Comment {lm['keyword']} and I'll send it to you."
- The founder replies personally with the resource (no auto-DM). Set
  comment_trigger to exactly: "Comment {lm['keyword']} and I'll send you {lm['promise']}."

- CTA is follow/save/share/comment ONLY.
