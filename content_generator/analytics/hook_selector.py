"""
Hook A/B Selector + Creative Fatigue Detector.

Hook A/B:
  Every reel arrives with a primary hook (hook_text) and an alternate
  (alt_hook). Growth reels arrive with up to 10 hook_options.
  score_hook() rates each candidate 0-100 on curiosity, emotional impact,
  scroll-stop power, simplicity, and shareability; the winner is promoted
  to hook_text before publishing. Heuristic scoring — zero extra LLM calls,
  so it never costs TPM budget or adds latency.

Fatigue detection:
  Tracks the hooks/CTAs used in the last 60 days (from the learning log and
  published-post tracker). get_fatigue_block() returns an avoid-list block
  injected into generation prompts so the engine never repeats itself.
