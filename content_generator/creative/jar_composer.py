Jar Composer — converts actual Purity Beans jar PNGs into usable references
for every image/video generation API in the pipeline.

Three generation modes:
  - avatar_mode   : AI character (persona) holding / interacting with the jar
  - ugc_mode      : lo-fi authentic "real customer" frame with jar in scene
  - reel_hook_mode: cinematic scroll-stopping still frame using jar as hero

Every mode uses the actual jar images from brand_assets/ as reference input.
