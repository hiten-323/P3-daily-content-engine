"""
Version registry — one place for every version stamped on content.

Every generated asset carries these, so a published post can be reproduced
and debugged months later ("which prompts/schema/publisher produced this?").

Bump the relevant constant when you change that layer:
  PROMPT_VERSION    prompt wording / structure changes
  SCHEMA_VERSION    required fields or validation rules change
  PUBLISHER_VERSION publisher request/response behavior changes
  ASSET_FORMAT      image/video composition changes

policy_version is deliberately NOT here — it lives in founder_policies.yaml
because the founder owns it (see founder_policy.py).
