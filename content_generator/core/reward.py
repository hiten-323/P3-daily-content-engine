"""
THE reward function — the single definition of "success" for this engine.

The engine has a business hierarchy, not a flat engagement contest:

    revenue -> orders -> conversion intent -> audience growth -> engagement

Revenue and orders therefore receive deterministic hierarchy prefixes before
KPI-specific optimization. This prevents a large follower/view count from
outscoring a smaller but real commercial outcome.

Missing-data contract: absent or None metrics are UNKNOWN, never zero. Real
numeric zeroes remain measured zeroes.

# Lexicographic business hierarchy encoded as score prefixes.
#
# ORDERS get the prefix; ATTRIBUTED REVENUE does not. They are different kinds
# of evidence and the repo's own tests encode the distinction:
#
#   test_learning_evidence_guard  1 order must outrank 10,000 follows
#   test_reward_objective_integrity  100 follows must outrank Rs 1 of revenue
#
# Both hold once you notice what each number means. An order is a discrete,
# completed conversion — a real person bought coffee, and that outranks any
# amount of engagement. Attributed revenue is not discrete: attribution is
# day-level and splits a day's takings across that day's posts, so a post can
# be credited Rs 0.33. Letting a fractional accounting artefact outrank a
# genuine audience gain is what GOAL_HIERARCHY.md blocks by name — "selling
# harder at 105 followers would raise short-term revenue but kill reach ->
# blocked (L2 growth staging > naive L1)".
#
# Revenue keeps its per-profile weight, so it always contributes and a
# revenue-KPI run still ranks it highest. It simply does not get to dominate
# the followers stage on a rounding artefact.
#
# Previously both were prefixes, and REVENUE_HIERARCHY = 1_000_000 made Rs 1
# beat 10,000 followers 2.5x. Both tests above failed; neither was wired into CI.
