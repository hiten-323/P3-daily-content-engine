"""
Slot registry — THE definition of when the engine runs and what each run owes.

Scheduling used to be stated in three places: the cron list in daily.yml, the
FORCE_SLOT mapping beside it, and the table in scheduler/slots.py. They drifted,
and the drift was invisible because every copy described its times as
"owner-chosen": the workflow fired the publish slots at 08:00 and 20:00 IST
while slots.py documented — and the founder had chosen — 10:00 and 22:00. The
workflow is the one that actually runs, so every Instagram post went out two
hours early for as long as that disagreement existed.

Python is now the source of truth. The workflow still holds the cron lines,
because GitHub requires them there, but they are DERIVED values: test_config_drift
regenerates the expected crons and FORCE_SLOT branches from this file and fails
if the YAML has moved away. Editing the YAML alone can no longer change the
schedule silently.

To change a publishing time, edit SLOTS here, then run:

    python -m content_generator.core.slot_registry --workflow

and paste the printed cron block and FORCE_SLOT expression into daily.yml.
