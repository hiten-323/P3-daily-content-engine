    #    This suite runs in the CI pre-publish gate, so anything it fails blocks
    #    the whole pipeline from publishing. That is right for code defects and
    #    wrong for observations about production data, which drifts by nature.
    #
    #    The concrete hazard: a post that genuinely reached zero people is a
    #    real measurement, but `reach or views` reads falsy, so it would have
    #    been counted as an unmeasured row — failing the gate and stopping the
    #    account from publishing because one post did badly. A data-quality
    #    warning must never become an outage.
    #
    #    The behavioural guarantees above (a failed fetch records nothing, a
    #    measured zero is preserved) are the code contract and stay blocking.
